# CodeToIMageLettersDataset
This repository contains a project to build a dataset of image letters.

The code was developed using the Wolfram Language and the Mathematica Software. 

My final objective is to create a machine learning model that allows me to identify single letters in an image. I want to apply this model in an iOS app that allows the user to solve hunting words game in an automatic way. 

I did a tech talk about this subject [here](https://youtu.be/Sc9Ul_bxhxY ).
